## 👋 Hi everyone! 👋 
- 👨‍🎓 My name is Lynx and I'm a programmer. 👨‍🎓 
- 💻️ I entered the computer world out of passion for computers and digital culture in general. 💻 
- 🤣 I'm pretty methodical when it comes to programming and pretty picky about every detail, so don't be surprised if you see weird stuff 🤣 

## 📖 My work in computing 📖 
- I am a person who loves programming but I never have a fixed goal. When I get an idea, no matter what language I want it in, I make it. 
- I am a very detailed person with each point and each space of my code. 
- 💢 I **HATE** especially the **CODE THEFT** 💢. 
- I am a very motivated person in computing and I am sure that I will continue like this all my life.
